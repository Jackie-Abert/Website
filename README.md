# Resume Website

This is a website I am continuously adding to during an intense boot camp to hopefully teach me how to code. I would eventually like to get a job doing this. So... here goes nothing.

## Sections

So far this site has one page containing three sections:

* An intro about who I am and my skill set
* Info about me and what led me to coding
* Contact info

## Where It's Heading

I have so many ideas about what I would like this site to become, but not enough technical knowledge to make it happen. I am learning as I go so there will be **many** improvements to this as the months go by.

## To the reader

First off, thanks so much for reading this. I didn't know people read these things to the end. So welcome. It's good to have you here. Feedback is always appreciated. I am still very new to GitHub so if, in fact, you can leave feedback I would love to hear your thoughts.

And again, thanks for stopping by.
