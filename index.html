          <h2 id="intro">Who Is Jackie Bishop?</h2>
          <p>My name is Jackie and I am a front end web developer and designer. I live about twenty minutes outside of Philadelphia in the quaint little town of Beverly NJ.</p>
          <p>After graduating art school with a major in photography and a minor in graphic design, I decided to push myself further and bring my design knowledge to the web development table. Over the years I have aquired a very special set of skills including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>15 years of Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator experience</li>
            <li>A fantastic sense of design and composition</li>
            <li>An in-depth knowledge of workflow and time management</li>
            <li>The ability to work well with others towards a common goal</li>
            <li>The art of listening to what people really want and need</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

          <p><img class="img-style" image-box src="images/jackie-portrait-1.jpg" alt="image of Jackie Bishop"></p>
          <p>When I graduated college, I got a job working for an E-Commerce business as their main photographer and graphic designer. To lighten the workload when my coworkers called out, my boss taught me a bit about various computer languages so I could fill in where needed.</p>
          <p>I grew to love the work and decided to further both my knowledge and my career. Web development became a passion for me and I enjoy using all the knowledge I have gained to develop websites that are not only functional, but also elegant and beautiful.</p>
          <p>When I am not coding or designing, you'll catch me gardening with the kids, gaming with my hubby, or fixing up our humble little home.</p>
