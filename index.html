              <p>My name is Jackie and I am a front end web developer and designer. I live about twenty minutes outside of Philadelphia in the quaint little town of Beverly NJ.</p>
              <p>After graduating art school, with a major in photography and a minor in graphic design, I decided to push myself further and bring my design knowledge to the web development table. Over the years I have aquired a very special set of skills including:</p>

              <p>When I graduated college, I accepted a job working for an E-Commerce business as their main photographer and graphic designer. To help further my knowledge and become a greater asset to the company and to my team, my boss taught me a bit about the various computer languages he used for the business.</p>
              <p>I grew to love the work. I became fascinated with code and decided to further both my knowledge and my career in web development.</p>
              <p>I would like to work with a team of like-minded individuals that share the same passion for coding as I do to build websites that are not only functional, but elegant and beautiful as well.</p>
              <p>When I am not coding or designing, you'll catch me gardening with the kids, gaming with my hubby, or fixing up our humble little home.</p>
